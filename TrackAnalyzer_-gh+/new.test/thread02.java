// Case 2
// Java Program to illustrate Difference between Runnable
// & Non-runnable Threads And Single Inheritance

// Class 1
// Helper thread Class extending main Thread Class
class MyThread1 extends Thread {

    // Method inside MyThread2
    // run() method which is called as soon as thread is
    // started
    public void run() {

        System.out.println("Thread 1 is running");

// Main thread Class extending main Thread Class
class MyThread2 extends Thread {

    // Method
    public void show() {

        // Print statement when thread is called
        System.out.println("Thread 2");

// Class 3
// Main Class
class thread02 {

    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Creating a thread object of our thread class
        MyThread1 obj1 = new MyThread1();
        MyThread2 obj2 = new MyThread2();

        // Getting the threads to the run state

        // This thread will transcend from runnable to run
        // as start() method will look for run() and execute
        // it
        obj1.start();

        // This thread will now look for run() method which is absent
        // Thread is simply created not runnable
        obj2.start();
	
	// and now we run the code in obj2
	obj2.show();
